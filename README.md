# Minima DApp System (MDS)

Blockchain data come from the Minima DApp System

Functions used are

-   commands.txpow_address(address)
-   commands.txpow_txpowid(txpowid)
-   commands.txpow_block(blockNumber)

These return a TxPow object

TODO - show TxPow type
TODO - why are we using that type
TODO - what properties do we use and what do we do with them

TODO - block type txpow vs transaction type txpow

# MDS Setup

-   Dapps directory, new folder 8083
-   dapp.yml

Uses useStatus() hook which polls mds. TODO - do we want to keep this or use the websocket??

# Tooling
